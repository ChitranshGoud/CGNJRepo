        <p>
            By downloading or using the app TodaysUsage, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You're not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You're not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn't try to translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to AppsOfIndia.

            <li>TodaysUsage is an internet data usage/consumption tracking tool</li>
            <li>The app is ad-supported with minimal advertisements</li>
            <li>No account creation or login required</li>

    </div>

    <h2>App Functionality</h2>
    <section class="sectionOther">
        <p>
            TodaysUsage is designed to monitor and track your internet data usage on Android devices. AppsOfIndia is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you're paying for.
        </p>
        <p>
            The TodaysUsage app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, to provide our Service. It's your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone's security features and it could mean that the TodaysUsage app won't work properly or at all.
        </p>
    </section>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <section class="sectionOther">
        <p>
            The app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions. You are advised to review their terms and privacy policies:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank">Google Play Services</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/terms" target="_blank">AdMob</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/" target="_blank">Firebase</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/us/" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You should be aware that there are certain things that AppsOfIndia will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but AppsOfIndia cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don't have access to Wi-Fi, and you don't have any of your data allowance left.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using the app, you're accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you're using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
        </p>
    </section>

    <h2>App Usage Limitations</h2>
    <section class="sectionOther">
        <p>
            With respect to AppsOfIndia's responsibility for your use of the app, when you're using the app, it's important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. AppsOfIndia accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
        </p>
        <p>
            While the app is designed to provide accurate information about your internet data usage, it should not be considered as the sole source of truth for your data consumption. Various factors can affect the accuracy of data tracking, including but not limited to system limitations, technical issues, or changes in how your device reports data usage. Users should cross-verify important data usage information with their service providers.
        </p>
    </section>

    <h2>App Updates</h2>
    <section class="sectionOther">
        <p>
            At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements for the system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you'll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. AppsOfIndia does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
        </p>
    </section>

    <h2>Changes to These Terms and Conditions</h2>
    <section class="sectionOther">
        <p>
            We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.
        </p>
        <p class="last-updated">
            These terms and conditions are effective as of April 13, 2025
        </p>
    </section>

    <h2>Advertisements</h2>
    <section class="sectionOther">
        <p>
            TodaysUsage is an ad-supported application. We generate revenue solely through displaying minimal advertisements within the app. By using the app, you agree to the display of these advertisements.
        </p>
        <p>
            We strive to ensure that all advertisements are appropriate for all users, including children (content rating 3+). However, the content of advertisements is controlled by our third-party advertising partners, and while we make efforts to ensure appropriate content, we cannot guarantee the nature of all advertisements displayed.
        </p>
    </section>

    <h2>Offline Functionality</h2>
    <section class="sectionOther">
        <p>
            TodaysUsage is designed to work offline and does not require any primary server connections to function for its core features. The app does not call any APIs or transmit user data to external servers for its basic functionality. However, certain features, including but not limited to advertisements and analytics, may require an internet connection to function properly.
        </p>
    </section>

    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <section class="sectionOther">
        <p>
            These Terms and Conditions shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of India, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect.
